# GAN-based-data-augmentation-for-improved-hate-speech-detection
SeqGAN data augmentation is used for improved hate speech detection, and we use the SMOTE oversampling method as the baseline. We also use four trained classifier-SVM,LSTM,BERT,Logistic regression.
# Requirments
* Tensorflow 1.15.0
* Python 3.7
# Classification model
If you want to use the classification model, click directly on the __classificaition model__ folder, in which you will see two __.ipynb__ files, containing all 4 classification models. The training set, test set, and validation set in csv format used in the model can be seen in the __data set__ folder.
